This project demonstrates a hand tracking system developed using Python and OpenCV. The application captures real-time video input from a webcam and detects hand landmarks, making it suitable for applications such as gesture recognition and human-computer interaction.

---> Key Features :)

- **Real-Time Detection**: Tracks hand movements and landmarks in real-time using webcam input.
- **Visualization**: Displays detected hand landmarks on the video feed for easy visualization.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a solid base for further development and enhancements, such as gesture recognition.
